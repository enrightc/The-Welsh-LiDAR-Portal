        <p>The Welsh LiDAR Portal is an independent project built to make Wales’ incredible LiDAR data open for exploration and discovery.

        Wales has nationwide 1m LiDAR coverage — some of the best in the UK — but until now there hasn’t been a dedicated platform for recording archaeology on it. This project was created to change that.

        The portal is a community science platform where anyone can:
          •	Explore LiDAR maps of Wales
          •	Discover archaeological features like barrows, enclosures, or field systems
          •	Record finds by drawing them directly on the map
          •	Save and manage discoveries in a personal profile
          •	Contribute to a growing, shared record of Wales’ past

        Our aim is to turn passive map viewers into active contributors, giving both beginners and experienced researchers the tools to explore, learn, and collaborate.

        This is an early version of the Welsh LiDAR Portal. Features are still being developed, so you may encounter changes or small issues as we continue to improve. Your feedback will help shape the final platform.</p>
